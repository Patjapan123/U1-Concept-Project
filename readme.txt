Spend ~3.5 hours (expected timeframe for the rubric) on a program that processes a set of data in a meaningful way. (expected timeframe for the rubric)
It should apply for loops and lists, normal variables, input and output through the console, and good means of abstraction using modules and classes.
It should appear as a polished program on the outside and inside, with comments remarking on out-of-place or difficult lines of code.
You may research topics, but if you add code from them in your program, it must be typed again by you and you must fully be able to 
explain them if asked.
